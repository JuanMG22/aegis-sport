      Hello, my name is Sandra Molfino I am the reborn artist behind Sweet
      Cotton Clouds Reborn Nursery. I started in this amazing world more than 10
      years ago as a collector. By that time, I was experiencing infertility
      problems and saw one of these beautiful babies on sale; I couldnâ€™t believe
      how realistic they were, and decided to buy one. After several years I had
      my first baby, and I continued collecting until my second baby was born. I
      felt that collecting was not giving me enough happiness, so invoking my
      painting skills and a great passion for this art, I decided to start my
      career as a reborn artist. This is how my dream of Sweet Cotton Clouds
      Reborn Nursery began. Since then, all my love and passion has been poured
      into each of my creations, each of my babies goes to their new homes with
      a piece of my heart. Here you can find some pics of my work but if you
      would like to see more you are welcome to visit my page.
